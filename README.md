# Unhandled JSON Access in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving the handling of JSON responses from APIs.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that directly accesses elements of a JSON array without checking for nulls or empty arrays, leading to potential `RangeError` or `NullPointerException` exceptions.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code that includes robust error handling to prevent these exceptions.

## Problem

The main issue is the lack of null and boundary checks before accessing elements within the JSON response.  If the response is unexpectedly empty, malformed, or lacks the expected keys, the application will crash.

## Solution

The solution incorporates thorough error handling.  It checks for null values and the existence of keys before accessing them, preventing runtime exceptions and making the code more robust.
